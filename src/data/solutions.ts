      {
        myth: 'You need 20% down.',
        truth: 'The median first-time buyer down payment is nowhere near 20%. Between 3% conventional, 3.5% FHA, zero-down VA and USDA, and down payment assistance, most first-time buyers put down far less.',
      },
      {
        myth: 'Student loans mean you cannot buy.',
        truth: 'Student loan payments count in your debt-to-income ratio, but they do not disqualify you. There are specific calculation rules for income-driven and deferred payments that often help more than borrowers expect.',
      },
      {
        myth: 'You should wait for rates to drop.',
        truth: 'Nobody can time that, and lower rates typically bring more buyers and higher prices. The better question is whether the payment fits your budget today. If rates fall later, you refinance.',

    faqs: [
      {
        q: 'How much money do I really need to buy my first home in Texas?',
        a: 'Beyond the down payment, budget for earnest money (often 1% of the price, credited back at closing), an option fee of a few hundred dollars, an inspection around $400 to $600, an appraisal of $500 to $700, and closing costs of roughly 2% to 3%. Some of that can be covered by seller concessions or assistance programs.',
      },
      {
        q: 'What credit score do I need to buy my first home?',
        a: '580 opens FHA at 3.5% down and 620 opens conventional. If you are below that, we build a specific plan — usually a few targeted moves that raise a score within 30 to 60 days.',
      },
      {
        q: 'How long does the process take from start to keys?',
        a: 'Preapproval is same-day to 24 hours. House hunting varies. Once you are under contract, 21 to 30 days is typical in Texas. Most first-time buyers go from first call to closing in about 45 to 60 days.',
      },
      {
        q: 'What is the option period in Texas?',
        a: 'A negotiated window, commonly seven to ten days, during which you pay a small fee for the unrestricted right to terminate the contract for any reason. It is when your inspection happens, and it is the strongest buyer protection in the Texas contract.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Should I get preapproved before I start looking at houses?',
        a: 'Absolutely. Touring homes without knowing your numbers wastes your time and risks falling for something out of reach. It also means that when you find the right house, your offer goes out the same day instead of a week later.',
