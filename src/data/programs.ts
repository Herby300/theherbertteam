      'Refinance your Texas mortgage with honest break-even math. Rate-and-term, cash-out, debt consolidation, and no-lender-fee options explained line by line before you commit.',
    heroHeading: 'Refinance Because the Math Works, Not Because Someone Called You.',
    intro:
      'Half the refinance calls homeowners get are from people paid to originate a loan, not to advise. My standard is simple: if the break-even is longer than you plan to stay in the house, I will tell you not to do it. When it does make sense — dropping mortgage insurance, consolidating high-interest debt, pulling equity for a renovation, or shortening your term — it can be one of the highest-return financial moves available to you.',

        myth: 'Refinancing restarts your 30-year clock, so it is always bad.',
        truth: 'It resets amortization, which is why I show total interest cost rather than just the monthly payment. You can also refinance into a shorter term or keep making your old payment amount on the new loan to stay on your original payoff schedule.',

        myth: 'Cash-out refinancing is risky.',
        truth: 'Converting unsecured debt to secured debt is a real tradeoff and deserves a serious conversation. But at reasonable loan-to-value with a stable payment and a plan not to run the cards back up, it is a legitimate financial tool.',

      {
        q: 'How do I know if refinancing is worth it?',
        a: 'Divide your total closing costs by your monthly savings. That is your break-even in months. If you plan to keep the home well past that point, the refinance makes sense. I run this for anyone who asks, with no obligation.',

      {
        q: 'How much equity do I need for a cash-out refinance in Texas?',
        a: 'Texas limits cash-out refinances on a primary residence to 80% of the appraised value, so you need to retain at least 20% equity after the new loan. Texas also has specific 50(a)(6) rules and timing requirements that I walk clients through.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Can I refinance to remove mortgage insurance?',
        a: 'Yes, and for FHA borrowers this is often the single biggest reason to refinance. Once you hold 20% equity, moving to conventional financing removes the mortgage insurance permanently, even if your interest rate stays roughly the same.',
      },
      {
        q: 'What is a no-lender-fee refinance?',
        a: 'The lender fees are covered through the pricing of the loan rather than charged at closing. Your rate may be marginally higher, but your out-of-pocket cost drops sharply, which shortens the break-even. I model it both ways so you can choose.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Will refinancing hurt my credit?',
        a: 'There is a small, temporary dip from the credit inquiry and the new account. Multiple mortgage inquiries within a 45-day window count as one. Most borrowers see scores recover within a few months of on-time payments.',
